To compile the projects you need to move "./Libraries/Encoder/" into the 
libraries folder in the Arduino program libraries folder (namely 
"path_to_arduino libraries/").

The following projects are included in the repository to include the 
following functionality:

GTNR_Battery_Controller**:
	- Controls onboard power and power sensing. 
	- Communicates with Atom board about onboard statistics.
	- Drives Lidar rotation motor

GTNR_Lidar_Test:
	- Testing for lidar communication

GTNR_Lidar_Test_Mega**:
	- Reads lidar data and communicates with the atom board. 

GTNR_Lidar_Test_Mega2:
	- Origional lidar data test with debugging code.

GTNR_Motor_Controller**:
	- Used to drive the motors
	- Detects light intensity
	- Detects IR distance

LidarSerialGen:
	- Used to simulate lidar readings for Java code debugging
